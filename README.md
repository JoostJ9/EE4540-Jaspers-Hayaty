The assignment points are split in the three points.
Assignment 1 for the creation of the field with sensors
Assignment 2 for the randomized gossip comparison with the pdmm average consensus
Assignment 3 for the median consensus algorithm

The algorithms themself are coded in the files with the respective names. 

Also some helper functions are created in the helper.py file to make the notebooks more readable.
